### Similar to the Original Burger Nom

The difference in this application is the use of Sequelize, a promise-based ORM. The original ORM has been removed, api routes have been updated to reflect the change in ORM source, and the rendering of HTML (via handlebars) was tweaked a bit and no longer uses buger-block.
